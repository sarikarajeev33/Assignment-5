# Assignment 5 - Gotta go FAST!
Final Due: Friday 4/23

# Goal
To play with the vagaries of optimization.

# Problem statement
You need to build code that can evaluate polynomials quickly! You have been given some code that can do it, but it is slow. Use the techniques from chapter 5 of your book and those discussed in class to make this code run as fast as you can.


# Final Submission
Due: Friday 4/23

Submit to GitHub:
* A file ***fastest.txt*** containing the CPE of your fastest run.
* Your ***poly.c*** code with your fastest run named ```poly()``` and all other modifications named meaningful things.
* A filled out ***Optimizations.md*** containing complete documentation of your process. This should be committed after each change is made.
* A ```Makefile``` that will allow me to ```make clean``` and ```make``` to clean all derivable files and make poly in the test harness.

# Assignment 5 - Gotta go FAST!
Design Due: Tuesday 4/9
Final Due: Tuesday 4/16

# Goal
To play with the vagaries of optimization.

# Problem statement
You need to build code that can evaluate polynomials quickly! You have been given some code that can do it, but it is slow. Use the techniques from chapter 5 of your book and those discussed in class to make this code run as fast as you can.

# Design
Due: Tuesday 4/9

To this very repo submit:
* A file ***questions.txt*** containing your questions.
* The answers to the following problems from your book (:  
    * Practice Problem 5.5
    * Practice Problem 5.6
    * Problem 5.15
* A file ***Optimizations.md*** containing documentation for your first planned change to poly. Each change should be documented with:  
    1. A section title with a reasonable name
    2. A description of the change
    3. The motivation for the change
    4. A copy of the function ```poly()``` that results from the change
    5. the CPE output line from the run (copied and pasted)

# Final Submission
Due: Tuesday 4/16

Submit to GitHub:
* A file ***fastest.txt*** containing the CPE of your fastest run.
* Your ***poly.c*** code with your fastest run named ```poly()``` and all other modifications named meaningful things.
* A filled out ***Optimizations.md*** containing complete documentation of your process. This should be committed after each change is made.
* A ```Makefile``` that will allow me to ```make clean``` and ```make``` to clean all derivable files and make poly in the test harness.
